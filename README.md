## Japanese History 2

### Introduction

As traditional historiographies of a country’s experience with modernity are mostly ordered according to an axis of ‘key moments’ or ‘junctures’ that were typically identified in hindsight (and, therefore, not visible as such to contemporaries), they often gloss over processes and/or structures that accumulate, build up over time and that are mostly latently present. Without attempting to reject traditional historiographies as unscientific or misleading, this course attempts to experiment with studying the latter.

Concretely, we use the history of money and financial technologies as a case-study. Largely defined by network effects (this is to say that their utility is increased in proportion to the degree by which others are willing to participate in their use), rather than political choice, this course attempts to uncover how consecutive Japanese governments a) dealt with Japan’s (lower tier) financial status and b) tried to move the country higher on the international pecking order. 
The story is one of rampant experimentation, mounting losses, and the occasional success. Importantly, the story is also an encounter with several of the most intensely dramatic aspects of the history of modern Japan. Financial affairs arguably determined the outcome of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905); success and eventual failure in World War I; and Japanese militarism on the road to World War II.

Methodologically, the course presents multiple chances to engage with primary sources. Because of money’s innate international nature (through international trade, exchange, investment etc.) quite a few official sources were published in English or in English translation. As such, they were elements in the Japanese campaign to enhance the country’s credibility and make the country’s financial instruments (bonds, debentures) palatable to the international investor.
