### Keywords

* `induced deflation`, `austerity`, `hard money`

### Points of discussion

* gold standard restoration fitted in a wider global trend towards so-called stabilization (e.g. price stabilization) and rationalization (合理化) and was described as a reaction to the inflationary wave that was fueled by the post-WWI reconstruction. Yet it was not the first, nor the last, induced depression in modern history: discuss. Remember that price stabilization and exchange-rate stabilization were/are different, yet complementary aspects of the deflationary mindset.
* try to pinpoint what constitutes the core idea and the primary problem of induced deflation (stabilizing/destabilizing). Why did high finance, in particular, have a stake in such policy? Were gains and losses equally distributed between creditors and debtors?
