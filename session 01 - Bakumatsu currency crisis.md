### A Timeline of Events

* see [here](https://github.com/michaelschiltz/Japanese_History_2/blob/master/related%20docs/session_1_timeline.pdf)

### Points of discussion

* a critical text examination: list the characteristics of Matsukata's report; who is his audience? what does he try to accomplish? how does all this affect out interpretation of his text?
* why could the pre-modern monetary system continue for so long? List the conditions for this; who or what was to gain from this set-up?
* why is it important to know that silver and gold were not mere commodities, but the country's currency as well?
* try to explain how Japan's adoption of the gold standard as a monetary standard is not a neutral event, but reflects the norms associated with a Great-Britain led world-order.
* do you see parallels with other past and/or contemporary happenings?
* **The [Kanagawa Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_Kanagawa) and the [Harris Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Amity_and_Commerce_(United_States%E2%80%93Japan)) (together with appendices) can be found in full-text version online (Wikisource contains only parts of the text): make sure to read these originals and point out the relevant articles. Students with a sufficient level of Japanese are strongly invited to consult the Japanese originals on the Wikipedia-pages (including ウィキソース), the [Diet Library](http://dl.ndl.go.jp/), or in [JACAR](https://www.jacar.go.jp/).**
