### Keywords

* isolationism, opening up, [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage), [Gresham's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law).

### Points of discussion

* a critical text examination: list the characteristics of Matsukata's report; who is his audience? what does he try to accomplish? how does all this affect out interpretation of his text?
* why could the pre-modern monetary system continue for so long? List the conditions for this; who or what was to gain from this set-up?
* why is it important to know that silver and gold were not mere commodities, but the country's currency as well?
* try to explain how Japan's adoption of the gold standard as a monetary standard is not a neutral event, but reflects the norms associated with a Great-Britain led world-order.
* do you see parallels with other past and/or contemporary happenings?

Note: Japanese era-names tend to confuse even the seasoned historian; for reference, see the following [template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Timeline_of_Japanese_era_names) (and a [Japanese equivalent](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%83%E5%8F%B7%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7_(%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC)).
